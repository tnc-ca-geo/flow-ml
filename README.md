Predict natural flows using machine learning

Introduction
Water is essential for California’s people, economy, and environment. Centuries of water management through dams and diversion have altered the flows in many streams and rivers, which can harm the freshwater ecosystems. The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and interns from University of San Francisco (USF) have written code to generate estimates of natural flows (expected streamflow in the absence of human modification) for streams and rivers in California.  The code uses machine learning techniques and is based on methods developed by the US Geological Survey (USGS).
